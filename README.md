# Sign-Language-recognition
It decrypts the sign language of the deaf and dumb.
There have been several advancements in technology and a lot of research has been done to help the people who are deaf and dumb. Aiding the cause, Deep learning, and computer vision can be used too to make an impact on this cause.

This can be very helpful for the deaf and dumb people in communicating with others as knowing sign language is not something that is common to all, moreover, this can be extended to creating automatic editors, where the person can easily write by just their hand gestures.

Project Overview

In this sign language recognition project, we create a sign detector, which detects numbers from 1 to 10 that can very easily be extended to cover a vast multitude of other signs and hand gestures including the alphabets.

We have developed this project using the OpenCV and Keras modules of Python.
